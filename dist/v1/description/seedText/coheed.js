    `Know now there is no time.`,
    `Space between the well and unknowing.`,
    `Our story starts there.`,
    `Well into our future, yet far beyond our past.`,
    `In a romance between a pair of unheavenly creatures.`,
    `The Five Houses of the Star Supremacy have privatized the detention zones of the galaxy.`,
    `These planetary prison pits reassembled from the cracked worlds of the Great Crash.`,
    `Which brings us to our stage.`,
    `Where the light must learn to love the black.`,
    `The Dark Sentencer.`,
    `It begins with them, but ends with me, their son, Vaxis.`,
    `Here, emotions behold.`,
    `You've entered a Hell where the Devil is made of gold.`,
    `Please, don't run your mouth.`,
    `The questions before have no place in this haunted house.`,
    `Reveal your selfish pleasure.`,
    `One more time 'round for good measure.`,
    `In the answer you hold.`,
    `Time would be better off if our souls had been sold.`,
    `In the place where the blind truly can see.`,
    `Welcome home.`,
    `Shed your skin and expose your bones.`,
    `Take my hand.`,
    `And follow us into the black.`,
    `So far that we can't get back.`,
    `Here, dig me a grave.`,
    `And toss in the lives that you can't be bothered to save.`,
    `You enjoy the sun while you sit in the purest sand.`,
    `Kiss your lover with that filthy mouth.`,
    `Here as evil now gropes.`,
    `It's caught us off guard with its hands reaching for our throats.`,
    `There's no telling when the truth is clear, pay it no mind.`,
    `Lines were drawn for us, for all sides.`,
    `In the afterglow, echoes of time unfold.`,
    `Give me your word, my dear, and promise you won't let go.`,
    `You may rest inside the night.`,
    `You can't save what the sleep implies.`,
    `It's a shame, I fear, from end to start.`,
    `A shame, I fear, from end to start.`,
    `I fear we've got all we had wanted.`,
    `Close your eyes and believe it didn't happen.`,
    `Now shut your mouth beyond your lies.`,
    `The world knows to stay away from you.`,
    `We laugh in the sun, maybe that's all we need.`,
    `I, and I, and I'm sorry.`,
    `You can't escape.`,
    `Here where the light only dies to remember.`,
    `A place where the blind truly can see.`,
    `Hear my voice, dearly departed, I beg on my knees.`,
    `It's been my pleasure to serve your disease.`,
    `We were young and had it all figured out.`,
    `We escaped through the alley in the back.`,
    `Judge told me, creature, don't you dare go back.`,
    `But I couldn't dodge the ringing in my head.`,
    `A lonely, subtle voice, through the echoes as it said.`,
    `Please don't leave me here, my love.`,
    `There was something I forgot to tell them then.`,
    `Between the kiss and Knock 'em dead, kid.`,
    `There will be no other like you.`,
    `Now I can't keep the guilt from my heart.`,
    `These stuttering emotions keep me fixed to fall apart.`,
    `And I know I'm leaving all this sweat in our bed.`,
    `The weight of the world on the shoulders, can you feel the thunder?`,
    `All unheavenly creatures.`,
    `Oh, all the unheavenly creatures.`,
    `We're all unheavenly creatures.`,
    `Oh, pretty angel, swinging from your cable.`,
    `I fear, my dear, the end is near.`,
    `Did anybody treat you better?`,
    `To obey and follow to the letter.`,
    `I fear, my dear, the end is here.`,
    `We can't dwell on what could've been.`,
    `All apologies.`,
    `The road that stretches out is calling us to find our way back home.`,
    `But you said it yourself, you said it yourself.`,
    `I know I'm hard to stomach.`,
    `But we need to move and get out of here.`,
    `Before this joint erupts.`,
    `And anywhere we go, we'll feel stuck.`,
    `Oh, what you want from me is not impossible.`,
    `Just give me some time to figure a way out of this mess.`,
    `For you and me, and I will, I will.`,
    `Oh, can't you see, as you drag me, I'm your favorite toy?`,
    `Now it's hard for me to come clean and I'll tell you why.`,
    `Did you miss me? Don't you lie.`,
    `Oh, I told you so.`,
    `Your broken heart is all my fault.`,
    `There's no room to disguise.`,
    `Oh, don't you cry, don't you cry.`,
    `All apologies won't make things right with you tonight.`,
    `Your favorite boy, your favorite boy.`,
    `Oh, you said it yourself, you said it yourself.`,
    `What you said, when you said what you need from me.`,
    `Oh, all apologies won't make things right for you tonight.`,
    `Oh, can't you see you're dragging me? I'm your favorite toy.`,
    `I'm so sorry but make up your mind, we're out of time.`,
    `Oh, mama, please, I'm on my knees, I'm your favorite boy.`,
    `You leveled everything I ever loved.`,
    `Disown me, disown me, disown me.`,
    `You can't be everything that I ever wanted.`,
    `Can't stop me, stop me, stop me.`,
    `I'll be the air you need when your lungs give out.`,
    `Teasing, teasing, teasing.`,
    `You'll be the care I need when I'm without.`,
    `Loving, loving, love me.`,
    `Hate, 'cause I am multiplying.`,
    `Who knew giving up would feel so good?`,
    `I, I lose, I lose.`,
    `Keep pretending it's trust and see what that gets you.`,
    `Your move, your move.`,
    `I'm tired of lying to you.`,
    `And letting you down.`,
    `The situation has turned raw from abuse.`,
    `I'll be your clown.`,
    `I'll be the one for you to use, black Sunday.`,
    `We're here to catch the bomb.`,
    `Cover over my eyes, cover over the lies.`,
    `For you to use.`,
    `Baby, I will be your falling star.`,
    `The one that got away, the one you'll be dreaming of.`,
    `Maybe we have been here once before.`,
    `The darkness rearranged, you're hitting well below the waist.`,
    `Wait, just relax.`,
    `Now, behave, the past is all you are.`,
    `Maybe things could be just like before.`,
    `No more that I can say before the world awakes again.`,
    `Is this everything you hoped for?`,
    `Lost in the lines between, the darkness found its queen.`,
    `When the lights went, when the lights went out.`,
    `All hurt in time gets better.`,
    `When the truth came out, you were born to run.`,
    `A ghost to haunt for closure.`,
    `When the lights went out, there was no one.`,
    `When the lights went out, there was no Queen of the Dark.`,
    `Oh, when the lights go out.`,
    `Abandon reason, listen to them shout.`,
    `Divine, these monsters of flesh and bone.`,
    `Oh, they make hate look so easy, no kind.`,
    `We are the animal.`,
    `Oh, how the times run out.`,
    `Everybody down on the ground.`,
    `Burn yourself here in the heat of the sun.`,
    `Pray it comes undone.`,
    `Scream your loudest, no one's coming.`,
    `Who raised these animals?`,
    `Broken migrant, knife through heel.`,
    `Sing your praise so Hell can hear.`,
    `Where did you come from?`,
    `The strange we walk, the touch we feel.`,
    `Could you find a way to love us all?`,
    `Don't wake up.`,
    `Show me stolen love.`,
    `Everything, I need.`,
    `Take away from me humility.`,
    `Over and over I fuss, but I can't seem to sleep as they cut.`,
    `Oh, no, you can't hurt me.`,
    `Break, break, breaking up.`,
    `Break, break, break, follow me.`,
    `Can, can, can you hear me?`,
    `The good you've done.`,
    `Don't feed us the animals.`,
    `'Cause we're not done with you.`,
    `There's no good you've done.`,
    `Oh, show me your true ugly.`,
    `The stranger you move, the sweeter you become.`,
    `Now show me the good you've done.`,
    `Show me the animal.`,
    `You locked a knife inside my heart.`,
    `Buried a key inside my mind.`,
    `The maps surveyed, the X you chart.`,
    `Where our hands go to hide.`,
    `Will our needs stay level.`,
    `As the terrain starts to grade high?`,
    `Should I remain unsettled?`,
    `Watch goodnight turn to goodbye.`,
    `Goodnight turn to goodbye.`,
    `The soundtrack placed over this heart.`,
    `It shares no rhythm of mine.`,
    `It juts and sways, it ends and starts.`,
    `All in and out of our time.`,
    `Oh, I can be your dancer.`,
    `The one you set within your sights.`,
    `When I admit surrender.`,
    `Then maybe goodbye will turn to goodnight.`,
    `Goodbye will turn to goodnight.`,
    `Oh no, we have been cursed.`,
    `The stage set for a tragic verse.`,
    `Our love protocol romance.`,
    `Our air drained of happenstance.`,
    `What have we turned ourselves into?`,
    `This abstract personnel.`,
    `Hold on to me.`,
    `Tell me you've got me, sweetheart.`,
    `The world is going dim in my gaze.`,
    `Sweet vertigo.`,
    `Feel my lungs heaving, choking.`,
    `Clawing down my back, panic attack.`,
    `I'm alone, watch me float as I fall.`,
    `Oh, watch me float.`,
    `Watch me float as I fall.`,
    `Carry them over your shoulders, you fear.`,
    `The absence, the void you'll cause.`,
    `When you choose to leave them all here.`,
    `There's no turning back, it's time that you steer.`,
    `The wide open stares back alone at the cusp.`,
    `The self that you thought you lost.`,
    `The shine that burned well into rust.`,
    `You can't hear my voice 'cause I'm not loud enough.`,
    `Believe me, when I say.`,
    `Goodbye for now.`,
    `You want me here?`,
    `The glistening wet concrete, the heat off the road.`,
    `The clamoring hands and the bus you call home.`,
    `This is it, believe what you want.`,
    `In this space, I don't fit.`,
    `The same day repeats with the things that you see.`,
    `Dirty dressing room carpets and broken TVs.`,
    `Is this it?`,
    `In this water I'll tread 'til the day that I'm dead.`,
    `Mile marker, minutes, hours.`,
    `If this is it and there is no more.`,
    `And you believe that's true.`,
    `It's a long way back from here.`,
    `There's no going home.`,
    `Hang on, it's clear that the road's about to get rough.`,
    `Oh, can you hear the ringing it's left in my ear?`,
    `Over and over, the light hits the dusk.`,
    `It's a choice that I make but for us, I choose to give it all up.`,
    `Goodbye for now, echoes, echoes.`,
    `Well, then ask me to stay.`,
    `Night-time walker, keep your distance.`,
    `Stay away from us, stay where you are.`,
    `History repeats its story, awakened by the sounds of long before.`,
    `I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna believe you're here.`,
    `But it's too hard not to when your songs I hear.`,
    `And all the sweet repeats that make it so beautiful.`,
    `Upside down, upside down, upside down, upside down.`,
    `A shattered silence into spinning.`,
    `The panic as you learn, there was nothing here worth living.`,
    `Hidden from this, an end, middle, beginning.`,
    `Imprisoned to watch a play where strangers stare, forgiving.`,
    `I believe that you and I have slowly made it to our final goodbye.`,
    `And when they ask, we'll stray to omit.`,
    `Only truly knowing that this us was how we want it.`,
    `Maybe it's alright and the world's not quite.`,
    `What you believed, it's now all upside down.`,
    `Go on, here in the sound I drowned, our nerves broke down.`,
    `What you believed is now all upside down.`,
    `It will be alright, we'll be alright.`,
    `It'll be alright, it'll be alright.`,
    `Sailing safely inside my head while we lay in the comforts of our own bed.`,
    `It'll be alright, we'll be alright.`,
    `Here, playing dead.`,
    `Maybe it's my night to turn it upside down and start things over.`,
    `Over my dead body.`,
    `The stars will let you know it's over.`,
    `Now, if I had my way.`,
    `I would leave you here to waste your final days.`,
    `Buried beneath.`,
    `With the possibility of how things could be.`,
    `Oh, please rest assured, this was not my fault.`,
    `And time is getting short.`,
    `So, I'll be here if you want me.`,
    `Oh, my darling, can you hear?`,
    `My words so pure they burn your lying ears.`,
    `Better call your mother.`,
    `When you're in your bed.`,
    `Sleeping toward the void.`,
    `So deep it feels like death.`,
    `Oh, don't you wake, wake.`,
    `Oh, my love, I hear life holds nothing for us.`,
    `Beyond our time in here.`,
    `Oh, don't you dare turn your back on me.`,
    `No use running when the bad guy's coming.`,
    `Oh, I think you've got me pegged as the wrong man.`,
    `Oh, I think you've got me pegged.`,
    `We were better together, I know that much.`,
    `Oh, can't you see.`,
    `Through the bad and the good, we had all the luck.`,
    `The devil's got nothing on us.`,
    `You and me.`,
    `Baby, over my dead body.`,
    `We're still counting on you.`,
    `We'll keep counting on you.`,
    `And we'll keep counting on you.`,
    `Mother, come on out.`,
    `Show me what the world is all about.`,
    `And we'll keep fighting for you.`,
    `We'll keep fighting for you.`,
    `And so the story goes.`,
    `When I leave, will you let me go?`,
    `When the words stop coming.`,
    `And the fear starts setting in slow.`,
    `Don't let me find you hiding under the covers.`,
    `It's your last chance, honey.`,
    `All hope is lost down in the gutter.`,
    `All or nothing that you say will make me stay.`,
    `Misguided by your loss and burning.`,
    `Oh, but you can't turn your eyes, you're glued to me.`,
    `So if you don't like what you see.`,
    `We'll soon find out who we are when all goes dark.`,
    `So, no longer me, no longer known.`,
    `Do these moments on display suffice your need?`,
    `Please forgive me if I disagree.`,
    `But your glimpse is now my nightmare.`,
    `All is lost and turned away.`,
    `From out of my head and into the fray.`,
    `Please make sure my door is closed when no one is home, no one.`,
    `Sweet Phantom, know now that I respect.`,
    `Your cautious pantomime.`,
    `Between what's said and what was meant.`,
    `A shifting paradigm, believe.`,
    `My lover, it's time I disconnect.`,
    `And find the end result.`,
    `Come slither, you snake, please bring me back.`,
    `To when life was wonderful.`,
    `Oh, this heart of mine, divine.`,
    `When you want it, it waits.`,
    `If you want it, it waits.`,
    `No longer do I, do I, no longer do I, do I.`,
    `'Cause all on fire, oh no, please bring water.`,
    `All on fire, oh no, please bring water.`,
    `Oh no, please bring, please bring water, please bring water.`,
    `We'll soon find out who we are, alone in the dark.`,
    `These broken hearts and promises that always fade and never start.`,
    `Have come apart.`,
    `Please bring water, please bring water.`,
    `A stale side double feature, so bad I couldn't eat ya.`,
    `Hyperdrive Mona Lisa, I wouldn't wanna be ya.`,
    `Your bright ideas always burn me, oh, you should.`,
    `Walk among us, come on and walk among us.`,
    `A bad guy, don't want to hate or love you.`,
    `Creature's coming.`,
    `Infected, don't provoke 'em, feel free to cock and load 'em.`,
    `Creature, come and get it, creature, come and get it.`,
    `Bright lights here don't concern me, if you would.`,
    `Come on and walk among us, come on and walk among us.`,
    `Can you imagine all I want?`,
    `The time we had and all we lost.`,
    `To be able to share that again.`,
    `These automatic feelings, I feel your impression, I feel as they return.`,
    `Oh, the dark has its beauty, a vision blindly bothered to pay you no concern.`,
    `Oh, the beast within me, it raged before, but I fear it's fell in last.`,
    `One down, two to go, I fear this stranger will not take me back.`,
    `Creature, come and get it, creature come and get it.`,
    `And all I know is if you want it all, my dear.`,
    `If you want it all my dear, go out and get it.`,
    `Hey, what became of my head.`,
    `The beats in my heart, the jokes that I said?`,
    `I guess all these false starts.`,
    `Of a puzzle you can't finish 'cause you're missing the best parts.`,
    `And don't you fear, I'm bringing you home.`,
    `Out of this pit where I left you alone.`,
    `In this horrible mess that I made.`,
    `But I guess that's what you get.`,
    `When you're not paying attention.`,
    `Baby, welcome back to confusing, perplexing.`,
    `The world could start believing me when I am dead?`,
    `I was a mess of a man with washed up excuses.`,
    `I know, I know part of the confusion is me.`,
    `We both agree that I wasn't the man that you needed me to be.`,
    `But, oh, how I changed and oh, how I've grown.`,
    `My everything, they need to see.`,
    `The choice is theirs to believe in me.`,
    `So baby, I'm back and I'm not gonna stop.`,
    `Baby, I'm back and I'm not gonna stop.`,
    `You and me, we're not enemies, I'm begging.`,
    `If anything, all we are, we are.`,
    `In harmony, sing with me, I plead.`,
    `Oh, if I can make things right then this will be our night.`,
    `The world against you and I.`,
    `We all go up in flames, go out in style, style.`,
    `And Heaven help us if they'd ever let us rest.`,
    `For just a little while, yeah.`,
    `We all go up in flames, going out in style.`,
    `Am I out of my head to think.`,
    `The world could start believing me when I am, I am dead?`,
    `Are you ready?`,
    `As the day we met.`,
    `You're adorable.`,
    `This could be the biggest mistake we make in this life.`,
    `Chasing as we tried to compete for each other's time.`,
    `From the world we locked ourselves inside, in a place to keep us safe from all to see.`,
    `They can't hide you from me.`,
    `We're still here in this life worth dreaming.`,
    `A lovely mess we find ourselves in, we brave it so bold.`,
    `Quietly, we dance through the heat, your hand as I hold.`,
    `But their warnings left us no concerns as we swallow the truth whole, unoriginal.`,
    `We're losing control.`,
    `Remember all the ghosts that you left them with.`,
    `Don't give 'em up, don't give 'em up, don't give 'em up.`,
    `Thank your lucky stars that we can call this ours.`,
    `I can be your heart, be your soul, just don't let me off easy, don't you let me go.`,
    `Thank your lucky stars.`,
    `We drift away with the dust.`,
    `The light consumes the dark recluse.`,
    `No time to waste in this mess.`,
    `I will retreat, no sin confessed.`,
    `How did we get so lost away?`,
    `Who will repair this broken heart?`,
    `This world will miss none of us.`,
    `The sick we cure, the bad we just...`,
    `Your spotlight on the subject, so incorrect.`,
    `Suggests that I am someone who you should not respect.`,
    `Oh, you wear your facade so well.`,
    `Covered up in a plastic shell.`,
    `You're a liar to everyone around you.`,
    `Just don't forget.`,
    `Don't close the coffin yet, I'm alive!.`,
    `And it's homecoming.`,
    `Can you remember.`,
    `When there was no wrong in what I can do?`,
    `Biting off way more than I could chew.`,
    `And then one day, I grew too old.`,
    `And my cares were now theirs to mold.`,
    `Please accept this as my resignation.`,
    `It's time to go.`,
    `Oh, I'm alive.`,
    `I will now bleed for what I believe in.`,
    `No more mistakes for them to make for me.`,
    `So goodbye, it's my time to be.`,
    `Face the honest truth, you were never you.`,
    `Now, be defiant, the lion.`,
    `Give them a fight that will open their eyes.`,
    `Hangman hooded, softly swinging.`,
    `Don't close the coffin yet, I'm alive.`,
    `Connection to principle craft has been lost.`,
    `Attempt to reconnect in 3, 2, 1... connection failed.`,
    `Recalculating navigation via secondary mobile apparatus.`,
    `Estimated speed: a falling rate of 263 knots.`,
    `Rate of survival: 33%.`,
    `How long have we been away?`,
    `Approximate calculation: 547 days.`,
    `Do you still want to go home?`,
    `I'm paranoid and sick of this.`,
    `World's misconception of things I did.`,
    `My language poured across this wrist.`,
    `In a metaphoric disaster.`,
    `My guess, I'm missing half the punch line.`,
    `Unless this hanging noose is fitted to be all mine.`,
    `There's never enough.`,
    `Oh, you're selling out to be in.`,
    `There's never enough cool for all...`,
    `These eyes ungoverned are tearing us apart.`,
    `Their ears forsaken have given up on art.`,
    `Now, why believe in anything they praise.`,
    `When one hand holds them the victor.`,
    `While the other holds the shovel to their grave?`,
    `Oh, this ticket window has closed.`,
    `Save your money, baby.`,
    `The next show's about to start.`,
    `Where else can you get to watch this talent fall.`,
    `One by one, they drop.`,
    `While you never understood me much.`,
    `Cause there's only one of me.`,
    `And too many of you fighting over nothing.`,
    `Oh there's never enough cool for everyone.`,
    `And before you know it, you're selling out.`,
    `You're selling all of me.`,
    `For too many of you fighting over nothing.`,
    `Oh, there's never enough cool for everyone.`,
    `And before you know it, you're selling out to be in.`,
    `I stood by everything I loved.`,
    `You're selling out to be in.`,
    `I have the great privilege and honor to present to you today the last great visionary in all our beloved company.`,
    `I present to you a man who brings new meaning to the ideas that we currently believe.`,
    `Ladies and gentlemen, it is with my great respect I give to you.`,
    `Attention, we have got a medical emergency.`,
    `The patient's condition is critical and fading.`,
    `Oh, I've got this under control.`,
    `But there is no guarantee.`,
    `Now, should you question this professional opinion.`,
    `It's time we'll spend wasting.`,
    `And oh, if you want to see.`,
    `Go on and tear it out of me.`,
    `This case is possibly the worst that I have ever seen.`,
    `I see how vulnerable we, as a people, can truly be.`,
    `Honey, release my heart, you let me go.`,
    `A radio transmission.`,
    `Sent to get the heart to listen.`,
    `Oh, this is love from a gurney.`,
    `Believe in Number City.`,
    `Release my heart if you, honey.`,
    `Do not let me, do not let me go.`,
    `I flew head first into the light.`,
    `Weightless, crisscrossing, precise.`,
    `In a dream, or was it life?`,
    `Inside this door, all answers wait.`,
    `So saddle up my steed.`,
    `Where the lies live way beneath.`,
    `Oh my, I think I've made a mess.`,
    `This is all my fault, it's what I've wished.`,
    `Please remember the better me.`,
    `No time to change my life in the air before.`,
    `Our maximum reach outweighed.`,
    `Apart, picture-less retreat.`,
    `The terror meets the truth, no longer who.`,
    `We now know what we must do.`,
    `Shadow-dancing through the roof.`,
    `Contact the life you used to know.`,
    `Gravity, the world in tow.`,
    `And I was wrong to let you go.`,
    `I accept my mistake, but you will never know.`,
    `This is my love into a ten-ton truck.`,
    `Driver, may I sleep with you tonight?`,
    `Numbered uncertainty.`,
    `City limits, shoe-strewn diary.`,
    `The roar of the engine won't cease.`,
    `Picture me, the perfect enemy.`,
    `Our lives are one, colliding up and beyond.`,
    `In this fatal possibility.`,
    `I am your, I am your prize.`,
    `We wave welcome aboard.`,
    `In my eyes, I drown you.`,
    `Have they forgotten their place?`,
    `Bait the hook and let it sink.`,
    `No cause for alarm.`,
    `Enter the master, I am Dr. Straight.`,
    `Scalpel, keep that lung in place.`,
    `Nurse, IV needs refilling.`,
    `Now watch the brain.`,
    `Responding quite normal, this life I can save.`,
    `Every person has a point where they break or conjoin.`,
    `Among pressure that floods to complicate.`,
    `Matters close to the heart will define who we are.`,
    `Do we love? Do we hate? We are only the meat, meat, meat.`,
    `We understood the unmistakable.`,
    `Two romantics on holiday, and how they stole our love.`,
    `Caged.`,
    `Locked in perpetual motion.`,
    `Carving our wounds wide open.`,
    `But you let the wrong one in.`,
    `Waiting for someone to set them off.`,
    `Morse code a-clicking out an SOS.`,
    `Life raft releasing the last breath.`,
    `Without me.`,
    `Will they reach the great beyond?`,
    `If we could escape this innocence.`,
    `Trapped between the fear.`,
    `And the words we kept.`,
    `We'll live out our later years.`,
    `Here, in our dreams.`,
    `We'll reach a great beyond.`,
    `Sinking in this beautiful undertow.`,
    `Together, with you.`,
    `We're giving up.`,
    `You can leave what little you believe.`,
    `Our flaw, discard.`,
    `Come give me what I need.`,
    `My thoughts won't go away.`,
    `You are my holiday.`,
    `And together, we'll receive.`,
    `And reach that great beyond.`,
    `Believe me, take my word.`,
    `I'll never break your heart.`,
    `And away we go.`,
    `Fly, and away we go.`,
    `The wish you plead and the things you sought.`,
    `We all think, we all thought.`,
    `The things I've done, and the world I've seen.`,
    `Don't measure up to you, my queen.`,
    `Oh, I take one for the other, and work my way through this machine.`,
    `The first train out, the last one drones.`,
    `We'll all sing.`,
    `We're going home.`,
    `As the curtain swings in to cover all our secrets kept, our love enough.`,
    `Give me the strength, I know, and please believe me.`,
    `What are you going to do?`,
    `Cause I don't want to lose your hold on me.`,
    `When I lose control.`,
    `Give me the, oh no, please believe.`,
    `Oh girl, this is what I've become.`,
    `And I'm going to leave it up to you.`,
    `What are you, what are you.`,
    `Pay no attention to this iron fist, this iron fist.`,
    `Just remember.`,
    `Pay no attention to this iron, oh, this iron fist.`,
    `When I lose control, oh no.`,
    `In those discouraging days.`,
    `I always missed the mark.`,
    `When we were comfort and close.`,
    `I would neglect to keep.`,
    `You safe and unexposed.`,
    `A portrait of time repeats.`,
    `This moment now replaced.`,
    `With an empty wish to give.`,
    `I give, I gave.`,
    `Now in your absence, I wade.`,
    `Through the coursing, lonely, lost.`,
    `And in this tragic dismay.`,
    `I never could believe what I became.`,
    `This welcomed war machine.`,
    `Here, in the dark side of me.`,
    `I couldn't give you what you needed.`,
    `It's all my fault.`,
    `Too coward to believe I lost it all.`,
    `I gave my everything.`,
    `For all the wrong things.`,
    `In this cold reality I made.`,
    `This selfish war machine.`,
    `Oh, this has become hell.`,
    `How can I share this life with someone else?`,
    `I promise you, there is no weight that can bury us.`,
    `Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt.`,
    `You fought to withdraw from a location which has incited severe, quantifiable pain, and nearly terminated the mission.`,
    `Nearly terminated your life.`,
    `Yet, you desire to set a course back to it.`,
    `I am not equipped to comprehend human rationale.`,
    `Is this what love is?`,
    `Two hearts beat as one.`,
    `Disguise your mind and feel the hum.`,
    `This drone, the buzz of our love.`,
    `In time, we move.`,
    `This churning factor, feel the groove.`,
    `Release the touch that moves you.`,
    `Push towards the dance floor.`,
    `And together, we'll show them who's boss.`,
    `We'll set a fire, once more.`,
    `I admit that I will never feel alone.`,
    `Once I call you home.`,
    `Maybe it's not now or later.`,
    `'Til you save the best for last.`,
    `I want to be everything you need.`,
    `I embrace your defects to confess.`,
    `You were my every wish.`,
    `I admit that I will never feel.`,
    `No, I will never feel alone.`,
    `Our sum in monotone.`,
    `While the record spins around.`,
    `Please turn me over, slide me into sleeve.`,
    `Oh girl, please bring me home.`,
