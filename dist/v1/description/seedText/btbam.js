    `Two arms in four-armed bed.`,
    `The touch of wind wrapping around me.`,
    `I'm trying to follow its scent.`,
    `The scent of isolation.`,
    `Every door opened, every aspect of our life is gone.`,
    `Hauling around our memories.`,

    `Vibrations forming my personal currency.`,
    `A lifeline.`,
    `A sweatbox, the linear mind as one.`,
    `Who would have thought?`,
    `This distant face.`,
    `Distant life never before seen.`,
    `Deep sleep in deep sea.`,
    `Nerves are torn from their ends.`,
    `It has been three nights and still the puzzle is cut by a shaky hand.`,
    `Carved out of improper materials.`,
    `A crushing sound soon awakes.`,
    `Where am I?`,
    `The taste of sand wipes away the grime of my past life.`,
    `The life I fled.`,
    `The grip I loosened.`,
    `It has all caused an even pressure.`,
    `The kind they show us on our screens.`,
    `I've become what I've force-fed my entire life.`,
    `A drifter's dream.`,
    `A loner's mind.`,
    `Wanting what they have.`,
    `Their perfect smiles and heartless lusts.`,
    `Over and over, like I've been there before.`,
    `Living and breathing, but still choking.`,
    `A mirror stares back.`,
    `On night four, they come back.`,
    `Awakening a new life.`,
    `Still nothing happens.`,
    `Your breath I breathe in.`,
    `I open my eyes to the smell of morning skin.`,
    `The soft touch of your hair.`,
    `Your breath I breathe in, breathe in.`,
    `The reality chases and catches up on actual alertness.`,
    `This is the last few years rolled into one instance.`,
    `I need something new.`,
    `A backwards day.`,
    `I jerk back in and out of a daydream self.`,
    `A cool breeze wrapping its smell around my skin.`,
    `The midday siren awakes what was a false idea of sleep.`,
    `Daydream society.`,
    `Walking past what we used to see.`,
    `Beginning again.`,
    `Walking into a certain state of suffocation.`,
    `The questions I face; the dealings I deal.`,
    `Do I complete me?`,
    `Do I complete humanity?`,
    `This day will determine it all.`,
    `Mirror stares back again.`,
    `I contort like the wheels in my head.`,
    `Still nothing ever happens.`,
    `Please wake up.`,
    `Memories left behind.`,
    `A new life, a new journey.`,
    `I've built anew.`,
    `For mankind; for my kind.`,
    `The vessel stares back at me.`,
    `From every angle, the menacing smile latches on.`,
    `Talking walls speak and spell my life story.`,
    `My past life.`,
    `The vessel sleeps beside me.`,
    `Am I God?`,
    `I've been called worse.`,
    `Morning skin of machine, of humanity's beginnings.`,
    `Drift in and out.`,
    `The vessel brings me sleep.`,
    `Mind bending strategy game.`,
    `Running through obstacles on a land never ventured.`,
    `Every night.`,
    `Alone but not for long.`,
    `The signals worked.`,
    `Did I want this?`,
    `I must go back and explain my reasonings.`,
    `Worse things have happened.`,
    `Worse things will happen.`,
    `The old atlas is found.`,
    `No matter what I do it's been done; it's been worse.`,
    `Imperfect; improper; extinct.`,
    `This is not reassuring.`,
    `They have found me.`,
    `A new journey.`,
    `I approach unfamiliar ground.`,
    `Left standing with the air swirling silently.`,
    `A creepy siren, the siren of loneliness.`,
    `Twisting, falling, and screaming.`,
    `Please break out.`,
    `The crumbling starts.`,
    `Inch by inch the ground takes over.`,
    `The wretched clench of my insides.`,
    `Unspeakable anguish, this contortion.`,
    `Awake, mime standing.`,
    `Air swirling around me, silent.`,
    `Siren of loneliness.`,
    `This is real isn't it?`,
    `Can't tell these days, the longest days.`,
    `Why the anger I wonder.`,
    `To create.`,
    `To recreate.`,
    `Secretly that title makes me feel comfortable.`,
    `In my place.`,
    `It's been a while.`,
    `Down to the last seed, I stand with a dark stare.`,
    `Still silent, still frighteningly silent.`,
    `I must leave myself.`,
    `That's what all of this has gotten me, infinite life?`,
    `Conquering of death.`,
    `The seed is planted.`,
    `Time to move on.`,
    `I'll make my own life seem new.`,
    `Face all of my mistakes and grow.`,
    `Must grow, grow, grow.`,
    `Many days and fewer nights, so I'm told.`,
    `I've lost my time years ago, so I'm told.`,
    `This will be the hardest part, so I'm told.`,
    `I wish my mind would work.`,
    `The explaining.`,
    `The whispered words.`,
    `The front door opened to the look of death.`,
    `Will this make sense?`,
    `Will this be comforting at all?`,
    `The questions dive in day and night.`,
    `Nothing we can do.`,
    `Nothing I can do.`,
    `Twists and turns must be answered.`,
    `I hit land, so it seems.`,
    `The dirt chokes up my legs, strong air then shoots down my throat.`,
    `Sensory overload in an instant of sense.`,
    `Charting through old water that I pushed away to drown.`,
    `Into another.`,
    `To find and be found.`,
    `This is what I've set out to do.`,
    `Where is this door?`,
    `The constant movement of my eyes.`,
    `I can feel, but I can't open the lids.`,
    `The back of my skin is scarred, torn and broken.`,
    `A reflection of what I've seen.`,
    `What have I become?`,
    `They let these people recreate.`,
    `Maybe I should have ended it all.`,
    `Too, too late?`,
    `Moving forward is a must.`,
    `Dig deep.`,
    `Commence sleep.`,
    `Commence sleep inside sleep.`,
    `An out of focus picture brings up a familiar scenario.`,
    `Three people fill the room.`,
    `There seems to be a fourth, but very small.`,
    `We are speaking about some sort of mission.`,
    `My mouth won't stop moving, talking way too much.`,
    `Even through the blur I can feel their stares.`,
    `This one sided discussion seems to be about what I am preventing.`,
    `Is this a sign?`,
    `I've said it before.`,
    `The people then disappear.`,
    `I look about and the western sky seems to be red.`,
    `I can smell burning.`,
    `Scorched life.`,
    `I turn around and the face of death stares so grim that the lids finally open.`,
    `I come to.`,
    `I'm close, very close.`,
    `But something isn't right.`,
    `A horrifying realization is swept over me.`,
    `The empty space of home.`,
    `All I've known is gone.`,
    `All I've loved is lost.`,
    `Everything's a novelty.`,
    `Everyone grows but me.`,
    `Everyone's in fragments.`,
    `From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem.`,
    `An entire existence revolving around what we can't acknowledge.`,
    `From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem, as they seem.`,
    `A brain malfunction we'll never admit as defeat, defeat.`,
    `A constant determination to find truths, to find truths.`,
    `To find reason.`,
    `An unspoken religion in being the all dominant, all dominant, all dominant.`,
    `This is what we call a brain.`,
    `This step will allow, allow the universe to run its course.`,
    `We have a short ticket and a lot is in hiding.`,
    `So let's take in what we can for now.`,
    `Just like here on Earth, a notion we do comprehend.`,
    `Hide what others can't understand.`,
    `The universe is the biggest, biggest threat.`,
    `Overachiever that commands attention.`,
    `Brute force of hysterical, hysterical reasonings.`,
    `As humans, we could never be content with knowing all.`,
    `Yet we can't be content with the fact that our brains will never know.`,
    `A mental surgery.`,
    `A never-ending journey.`,
    `A technological drawback.`,
    `Pushing us further from our natural minds.`,
    `There will always exist a Kryptos.`,
    `Even things created by other humans should be considered.`,
    `In the experiment of an entire species of understanding.`,
    `A magician's pure joy.`,
    `A mind bend for the common folk.`,
    `Follow the straight line.`,
    `A full house watching what we can't see.`,
    `The ultimate deceiver.`,
    `Close one eye.`,
    `Step to the side.`,
    `Stepping in and stepping out.`,
    `We will always be part of the great misdirect.`,
    `Mirrors and Obfuscation.`,
    `I will do this for you.`,
    `Every natural thought or feeling you've ever had will change tonight.`,
    `Trust the pedestal, for now we become a higher being.`,
    `I am your new mind.`,
    `I am your new you.`,
    `I am your new sin.`,
    `I am your new lust.`,
    `I am for you now.`,
    `Control, collapse, and collide.`,
    `A letter plagued by a twisted word.`,
    `You will become mine, for there are no more options.`,
    `There will not be a sweet consolation.`,
    `This is what is supposed to happen.`,
    `A predetermined destiny put in motion by my stronger power.`,
    `You are me.`,
    `I sit on this dirty floor.`,
    `A weak mind for a cause.`,
    `A cause I do not know.`,
    `Don't know what to live for.`,
    `A compliment I've never heard.`,
    `A comfort I've never felt.`,
    `It's here, even though it won't last for long.`,
    `Sit down.`,
    `Stand up please.`,
    `Lay down, drink this please.`,
    `You'll be in peace soon.`,
    `A vision I will display to blind the caring.`,
    `I have regrets.`,
    `A tribe within itself.`,
    `Too late.`,
    `I am a friend by first impression.`,
    `My task: to recycle this earth.`,
    `To not repeat human history.`,
    `Start from scratch and rid every sound.`,
    `I've bid every method.`,
    `I have saved you.`,
    `Now you will follow my journey, my destiny.`,
    `Tonight's your death.`,
    `Resurrect my new you.`,
    `I am a cult by definition.`,
    `I will end this human world.`,
    `This world is a lie and I have proved this with my followers.`,
    `You are now dead, and I soon will be.`,
    `A Feed From Cloud Mountain.`,
    `Sweet candy populous.`,
    `A worry free entrance into the world's history.`,
    `Never underestimate; never think beyond their thoughts.`,
    `The satellites have been tapped and Cloud Mountain will carry on the commands of our ancestors.`,
    `Indeed we work from here.`,
    `We have for centuries.`,
    `Hearing every breath.`,
    `Watching every disease.`,
    `The leaders are driving to the farthest retreat.`,
    `Sit back, relax, enjoy the ride.`,
    `They have been speaking for years.`,
    `Every night while you're asleep they have been discussing what the future holds for us all.`,
    `The outer space takeover.`,
    `Worlds collide in a dreary pre-determined idea brought by our fellow night owls.`,
    `Their stories have been mocked.`,
    `Their ideas have been crushed.`,
    `A government overthrown.`,
    `But after last night they control every idea we will think from here on out.`,
    `We have come to tell you all that we could have prepared for this.`,
    `The apocalypse, at least our apocalypse, will happen sooner than we think.`,
    `If we don't read the journals our station has prepared for you all.`,
    `We call ourselves the night owls.`,
    `We've roamed the Earth for years and kept your world afloat.`,
    `We've made it so you stay comfortable in your precious homes.`,
    `While you sleep, we discuss.`,
    `Discuss our future; your future.`,
    `Our journals give detailed instructions on the machines and weapons we must build.`,
    `These are weapons that none of you would even begin to think could harm the outside world.`,
    `Everything you know is false.`,
    `Your first instinct is now your last.`,
    `Like I've said before, we have been discussing and planning this for decades.`,
    `We don't have time to explain everything, but just know that everything will soon change, will soon change.`,
    `Trust us and we will all be safe.`,
    `We are the new government.`,
    `In simple times, we must take control.`,
    `With simple skies, we create more sky.`,
    `A simple land we must change for man.`,
    `A simple life we must break.`,
    `How fast we grow.`,
    `We must move on.`,
    `The radio's stopped tuning.`,
    `The static is forbidden.`,
    `The chords quit strumming.`,
    `But we found our new home.`,
    `The drums quit thumping.`,
    `These tones are forbidden.`,
    `The throat can't start singing.`,
    `The scarecrow is watching.`,
    `It will rain, falls so slow.`,
    `It will rain down here.`,
    `Here we sing.`,
    `Sing with the fear.`,
    `Fear: the control tower.`,
    `The new sun comes by the hour.`,
    `Ghosts slowly disappear in the fog.`,
    `Silence is suffering.`,
    `We've built back the age-old sound of song.`,
    `Sound of song.`,
    `Here, we're awake in the desert of song.`,
    `The silence is broken.`,
    `Here, we're awake in the.`,
    `Silence is broken.`,
    `It's been a long night away from it all.`,
    `The grabbing authority of my peers.`,
    `The rusty cage that never seems to open.`,
    `When can I escape?`,
    `When can I swim to the moon?`,
    `I've heard this expression my entire life and never realized how peaceful a statement it is.`,
    `All alone on the worlds waters.`,
    `The sun's slowly drifting past the edge of the world.`,
    `I'm the loneliest boat on this entire body of water.`,
    `Rest will give my awakening purpose.`,
    `This is why I have come here in the first place.`,
    `A peace I have never felt.`,
    `A life I did not want to live.`,
    `I will awake through sleep.`,
    `Look into the picture.`,
    `No more panic, no more regret.`,
    `No more hoping for a new mess.`,
    `I awake with a cool breeze blowing through my dirty hair.`,
    `Rested, stable, a first.`,
    `A caffeine junkie's longest wish: peace and quiet.`,
    `No wake ups, no expectations.`,
    `A strange feeling. suddenly drifting.`,
    `Filling a void that I can't quite put my finger on.`,
    `This loneliness I always seek.`,
    `No sign of human life in any direction.`,
    `The most peaceful event of my life seems to have typically turned into a struggle.`,
    `I'm in the middle of black water.`,
    `No sign of human life.`,
    `Panic takes over my body.`,
    `I have indeed floated due to a non-reversible decision to flee.`,
    `Just for a day I told myself, my survival skills were lost years ago.`,
    `Here I am: no food, no clean water, and this extremely embarrassing attempt at a get away outfit.`,
    `This is an inevitable death.`,
    `Slide into the water.`,
    `Become one with the sea.`,
    `Life seems so much smaller.`,
    `Swim to the moon.`,
    `Look into the pictur.`,
    `This is what I lived to be.`,
    `This very moment is the first time in my life that I've felt pure joy.`,
